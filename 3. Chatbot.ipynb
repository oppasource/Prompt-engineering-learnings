    "Chatbots differ from language model in the sense the response is based on the context of the conversation. We demonstrate this with an example where we try and ask our name. In standalone LLM case, it fails to answer with our name. But in case of chatbot where we have told our name already in previous chat, it picks up the context and gives back our name.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the concept of __System Message__ which can be thought of as a prompt that sets the tone for the chat. We can define set rules for how or in what way we want the chatbot to respond by giving an initial system message."
