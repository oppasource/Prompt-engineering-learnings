# Prompt-engineering-learnings

## Acknowledgement

This project have been possible only because of DeepLearning.AI. Thankful for their lectures, which they were kind enough to publish free of cost. All code in this repo was ran and tested on the notebook hosted by DeepLearning.AI which had OpenAI Access Tokens exported within them. The outputs from those notebooks have been taken and pasted in notebooks present in this repo for reference. 

This project does not cover each and every detail taught in the couse by DeepLearning.AI but only serves as an experiment to build toy examples for few of the concept taught in the course.
