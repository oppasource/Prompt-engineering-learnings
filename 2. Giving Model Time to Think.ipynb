    "Just like humans, LLMs also need time to think of a solution. Humans generally tend to think of solution by going through steps. If there is mathematical calculation involved, humans solve it by calculating the parts of the equation first and then substituting the value in final equation to get final answers. Similarly LLM may also get confused we final answer is asked directly. In this notebook we show how the LLM answers can improve in calculation accuracy by asking the model to sove in steps or give it the steps to solve."
