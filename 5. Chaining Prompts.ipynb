    "# Chaining Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, in an information system a database is involved and operations are performed on that database. If we want LLMs to have information about our database so it can repond to user queries with that information then it becomes tough to provide the complete database information in one single prompt. This is where chaining prompts can be useful. The way system is designed is that we use frist prompt to get entities or attributes to query to the db. Then we retrieve the information about those entities and attributes from database rather than the complete database. This retrieved data is passed through the second prompt to get user response based on that retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining prompt basically means breaking down one single problem into bunch of problems or prompts and chaining them together. This can help reduce the prompt size by not overloading prompts with information and thus making it more efficient in terms of performance and cost. Please note that any operation can be performed like calling an external API in between prompts which makes it very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we take an example where we try and build a system that answers queries around movies. For demonstration purpose, we expose 2 APIs to retrieve movie data by name and genre. We first etxract which movie titles and genre is user asking information about. We then use the APIs to retrieve information about those entities and then feed this data in another prompt with the same user query to generate a response."
